### Hi, I'm Jasmine 👋
- 📚 I'm a first-year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I strive to create products that have a meaningful and positive impact on society.
- 💼 I'm currently working as a Web and Mobile Developer at Rich Media and I’ve previously worked at Ritual as a Test Automation Engineering Intern, and looking for opportunities for Spring 2022.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love growing vegetables and succulents in my spare time!
